# Binary Classification Metrics

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to build and evaluate a logistic regression model for binary classification. Using the breast cancer dataset from scikit-learn, we will classify whether a mass of breast tissue is benign or malignant. The notebook covers data preprocessing, model training, and a detailed assessment of the model's performance using various classification metrics.

## Repository Overview

### Key Features

- **Building a Logistic Regression Model**: Step-by-step guide to creating a logistic regression model using the breast cancer dataset.
- **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load and explore the dataset, including handling class imbalances.
- **Model Training**: Train a logistic regression model and extract key parameters such as intercept and coefficients.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using confusion matrix, overall accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and a comprehensive classification report.
- **Interpretation of Metrics**: Discuss the significance of each metric and interpret the results in the context of the class imbalance.

### Dataset

The dataset used is the breast cancer dataset from scikit-learn, which includes features computed from digitized images of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast mass tissue. It contains 569 instances, each with 30 features, and a target variable indicating whether the mass is benign (1) or malignant (0).
